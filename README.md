## Data and R files ## 

These files underpin my article in *Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe*. The article has now been published and can be accessed at the link below. It follows up on research which I've published about political support in European democracies, specifically in the Federal Republic of Germany.

This repository holds data and r files from which I conducted research on how Germans evaluate the Constitution, *Basic Law*. This research formed the basis of my article in the  *Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe*. I will add a permanent copy of the article as soon as copyright enables me to do so. In the meantime, you can access it [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/8BWNMYNC8AYX6RFASES9/full?target=10.1080/25739638.2020.1833562)

Over the last ten years or so, academic research in the arts and social sciences has increasingly embraced the principles of transparency in research. These remain contested in some respects - and, in part, I share some of the concerns of my colleagues. 

But enabling people to reproduce your workflow is a crucial benchmark of open research. There have been a lot of articles written about this and the points made are very goon ones. Open research enables interested researchers not only to read your results, but to understand how you generated your results in the first place. Moreover, they demonstrate how they may be replicated. This is a good principle to adopt and I intend to populate my github with the necessary data and r files.

I hope this helps you to do so.
