### Repository for article in *Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe* <br/> <br/> Ross Campbell, Ph.D. ###

## Overview ##

This repository contains files for my article in *Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe*. The article can be accessed [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/8BWNMYNC8AYX6RFASES9/full?target=10.1080/25739638.2020.1833562). It extends research which I've published about political support in the Federal Republic of Germany and you can find more about this in my [book](https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9783030037918). In this article, I challenge suggestions that Germans have lost faith in democracy. As many readers will know, much scholarly literature claims that trust in democratic institutions has declined. In my view, however, the empirical basis of those claims is questionable (Campbell 2019: 79:80). In addition, comparatively little is known about how Germans assess more important parts of their democracy. The research of my article focuses on how they evaluate their constitution, the *Basic Law* and shows that attachments to the constitution are quite widely spread across the population and have deepened in parts of the country where they were previously shallow. I use generalised linear modeling (GLM) and post-estimation analyses to show that these attachments are grounded in characteristics that are likely to make them endure. In summary, then, I argue that the evidence suggests German democracy is somewhat more resilient than has previously been thought. 

### Rationale ###

Over the last ten years or so, academic research in the arts and social sciences has increasingly embraced the principles of transparency in research. These principles remain contested in some respects - and, in part, I share some of the concerns of my colleagues. However, enabling people to reproduce your workflow is a crucial benchmark of open research. This enables interested researchers not only to read your results, but to understand how you generated your results in the first place. And it enables interested researchers to replicate the findings. This is a good principle to adopt and I intend to populate my github account with the data and r files from my published work.

In many respects R has facilatated this. Although it is open source software to use it effectively you need a clear (and reproducible) workflow. The files contained in this repository will be enough to replicate the empirical models and visualisations of my research.
