# Data and R files #

This repository contains files for the research of my article in *Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe*, which can be accessed [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/8BWNMYNC8AYX6RFASES9/full?target=10.1080/25739638.2020.1833562). It extends research which I've published about political support in European democracies, specifically in the Federal Republic of Germany. In this article, I challenge assumptions about the degree to which Germans have lost faith in democracy. I show that attachments the constitution, the *Basic Law*, are quite widely spread across the population and have deepened in parts of the country where they were previously quite shallow. I also use generalised linear modeling (GLM) and post-estimation analyses to show that these attachments are grounded in individual characteristics that are likely to make them endure. All in all, then, I argue that the evidence shows German democracy is more resilient than has previously been thought. This repository holds data and r files from which I conducted the research.

# Why do this? #

Over the last ten years or so, academic research in the arts and social sciences has increasingly embraced the principles of transparency in research. It's important to acknowledge that these remain contested in some respects - and, in part, I share some of the concerns of my colleagues. 

But enabling people to reproduce your workflow is a crucial benchmark of open research. There have been a lot of articles written about this recently and the points made are very good ones. Open research enables interested researchers not only to read your results, but to understand how you generated your results in the first place. Moreover, they demonstrate how they may be replicated. This is a good principle to adopt and I intend to populate my github with the necessary data and r files from my published work.

In many respects R has facilatated this. It is itself an open source software package, but to use it effectively you need a clear (and reproducible) workflow.

So this is the first of many repositories.
