## Data and R files for article in Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe ##

This repository contains data and r files to replicate results published in my article in Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe.

Over the last ten years or so, academic research in the arts and social sciences has increasingly embraced open source software and the principles of transparanecy in research. These remain contested in some respects - and, in part, I share some of the concerns of my colleagues. 

But enabling people to reproduce your workflow is the benchmark of research. This enables interested researchers not only to read your results, but to understand how you generated your results and demonstrate how they may be replicated. This is a good principle to adopt and I intend to populate my github with the necessary data and r files.
